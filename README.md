# **Browser-Snake**

## **Description**

The video game where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line,

often themed as a snake, but in the browser.

## **How to set up**

After you have downloaded and extracted the files,

you need to open the index.html file.

## **How to play**

Press the play button on the home screen

and then use the arrow keys to make the snake start moving.

To increase your score, you need to make your snake longer.

In order for that to happen, it needs to eat apples,

which happens when the snake's head goes through one.

The game ends when the snake either hits a wall or itself,

which is followed by a game over screen.
